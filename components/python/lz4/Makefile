#
# Tests are run from build directory that contains cloned copy of sdist.  We
# try to ask Python to find tested modules in the proto area (the PYTHONPATH is
# set accordingly), but Python (< 3.11) always adds the current directory to
# sys.path and there is no known (simple) way how to avoid that.  Except -I,
# but that would cause Python to ignore PYTHONPATH too so we would not have
# access to the proto area either.  The -P option together with PYTHONSAFEPATH
# environment variable were added to Python 3.11 only so we cannot use them yet
# for all Python versions we support.
#
# Since sdist for this project contains the main module in the top-level
# directory we cannot force Python to skip it.  But, unfortunately, this module
# does not contain built dynamic libraries, so Python cannot find them while
# testing.
#
# To workaround this we rename the main module in the build directory during
# testing so Python will need to defer to PYTHONPATH.
