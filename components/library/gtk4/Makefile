# Installed gtk4 libraries are causing many tests to fail and we didn't found a
# way how to prevent their loading.  There are basically these libraries
# causing problems:
#
# 1) libgtk-4.so - to avoid loading of the system installed libgtk we can do
#    this:
#
#	COMPONENT_TEST_ENV += LD_LIBRARY_PATH=gtk
#
#    but since we force the library/desktop/gtk4 uninstall we do not do that.
#
# 2) libraries in /usr/lib/amd64/gtk-4.0/4.0.0/printbackends/ - we have found
#    no way how to prevent their loading, except by removing them.
